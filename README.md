Sales Vendor Performance Analysis:-


Project Overview:-

This project analyzes vendor-level sales and profitability data to identify top-performing vendors, cost contributors, and overall business impact. The objective was to apply SQL and Python-based data analysis techniques to extract actionable insights.

 Business Objective:-

*Identify top revenue-generating vendors

*Analyze gross profit contribution

*Apply Pareto (80/20) principle

*Evaluate statistical significance of vendor performance

*Support vendor optimization strategy

 Tools & Technologies:-

1)SQL (CTEs, Aggregations, Joins)

2)Python (Pandas, NumPy)

3)Matplotlib & Seaborn

4)Jupyter Notebook

"Key Analysis Performed":-
1️) Data Cleaning:

a)Removed null values

b)Standardized numeric formats

c)Validated vendor IDs

2) KPI Calculations:

a)Total Purchase Dollars

b)Total Sales Dollars

c)Gross Profit

d)Purchase Contribution %

e)Cumulative Contribution %

3) Pareto Analysis:-

a)Identified top 20% vendors generating majority revenue

b)Visualized cumulative contribution curve

4️) Statistical Testing:-

a)Confidence Interval estimation

b)Hypothesis testing for vendor profitability

 
*Key Insights:-

1-Top vendors contribute disproportionately to revenue.

2-Small subset of vendors drives majority gross profit.

3-Statistical testing confirmed significant differences in vendor performance.

4-Optimization of bottom-tier vendors could improve profit margins.

 
 $ Business Impact:-

a)Supports strategic vendor selection.

b)Helps identify underperforming vendors.

c)Enables data-driven procurement decisions.
